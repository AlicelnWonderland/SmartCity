## Abstract
The SmartCity project aims to improve urban transportation by using artificial intelligence to predict bus arrival times. This study employs machine learning methods, such as Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, and XGBoost, to develop models capable of estimating the time of arrival at the next stop. The goal is to enhance arrival prediction accuracy and improve the city's overall transportation system.

## Introduction
The rapid development of technology and urban population growth create challenges for transportation infrastructure. AI-based systems are essential to improving the quality and convenience of transportation services. This project aims to develop a model that predicts public transport arrival times by considering factors such as time of day, day of the week, road congestion, and weather conditions. Implementing these technologies is expected to enhance transport service quality and reduce passenger waiting times.

## Methods and Materials
This study uses a dataset that includes public transport arrival and departure times, stop dwell times, travel times, and direction. The following machine learning methods were employed to build the model:
- **Gradient Boosting Regressor**
- **Random Forest Regressor**
- **XGBoost**

Model performance was evaluated using the mean absolute error (MAE) metric.

## Results
After training and testing the model on real data, the XGBoost method showed the lowest error in predicting arrival times. The mean absolute error values obtained for each model were as follows:
- **Gradient Boosting:** 15.2 seconds
- **Random Forest:** 12.4 seconds
- **XGBoost:** 10.8 seconds

These results confirm the effectiveness of machine learning methods for predicting public transport arrival times.

## Discussion
Arrival time prediction technology significantly enhances passenger service quality. However, to improve prediction accuracy, factors such as seasonal changes, weather conditions, and special city events need to be considered. Future research may focus on model optimization and the integration of additional factors.

## Conclusion
Within the SmartCity project, a system was developed to predict public transport arrival times using machine learning models. The results demonstrate high prediction accuracy, confirming the potential of such solutions for enhancing transportation infrastructure and passenger service.
